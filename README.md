## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📥 Installation

1. **Download the latest release** from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/super-lang-creator/releases)
2. **Extract the files** to your desired location
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python LangGen_Modular.py
   ```

### 🎮 Create Your First Language (5 Minutes!)

1. **🏠 Language Info**: Choose a cool name like "KidsCode" or "MathSpeak"
2. **🔤 Keywords**: Replace boring words with fun ones:
   - `variable` → `remember`
   - `function` → `teach`
   - `if` → `check`
   - `print` → `say`

4. **📤 Export**: Get a working programming language with documentation!

### 🎯 Example: Creating "KidsCode"

```python
# Traditional Python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Your KidsCode language
teach greet(name) {
    say("Hello, " + name + "!")
}
```
